# FinalProject
This is my uni final project 
related to anxiety monitoring using bpm, oxygen, and gsr. 
U can copy and modify the code as u like (for ur project ofc lmao).
Don't ask me anything regarding my own code, I alrd forgot.

Best of Luck

P.S there's some line that I blocked and as u can see I put random values there.
It was for the testing purpose back then, so my lectures can be sure that the code
is working.

P.S that was not ex like my ex, but it was for the website file, ik ik I'm just to lazy
